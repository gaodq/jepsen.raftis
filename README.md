# Raftis Jepsen Test

A Clojure library designed to test [Raftis](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd/tree/master/floyd/example/redis), a Redis protocol raft cluster implemented by [Floyd](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd).

## What is Raftis

Raftis = Raft + Redis protocol
Raftis support redis's kv interface for now. We implement the redis protocol consistent system with Floyd, a library that could be easily embeded into users' application. Raftis is just like zookeeper, etcd.

## Usage

### Install

- git clone https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd.git
- Compile Floyd and Raftis according to [Floyd README](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd) and [Raftis README](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd/tree/master/floyd/example/redis)
- Move compiled raftis to `/opt/raftis` on testing machines.
- Copy raftis manager script `start_raftis` `stop_raftis` `clean_raftis` to testing machines' `/usr/bin` directory.
- Add hostname `n1 n2 n3 n4 n5` to `/etc/hosts`

TODO: More flexible installing.
